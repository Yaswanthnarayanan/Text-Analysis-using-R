2019-09-22,2019,"“Who Provides GREAT ""Chat"" Support?”
Overall: Replaced ACT Contact Management System to provide realtime access to critical data to make decisions and deliver breakthrough support to our customers and vendors.
 Apptivo does! Although it's rare that I've had to use Apptivo ""Chat"" Support. Today, was another example where Naresh went above and beyond to get a Supervisor to fix an important Account Set-up. On a prior Chat call, Apptivo suggested a remote session where the representative quickly identified the Advanced Capabilities required to import a complex database. My company does not sell or represent Apptivo although we are in the enterprise software integration industry. Apptivo sets a new standard of excellence in support that organizations small and large can depend.","Additional pre-built integrations are time savers and Apptivo has more work to do in this area. Professionally, I'd rather have a solid framework of broad core features that is competitively priced than can be used by everyone in the company."
2019-09-19,2019,"“First time CRM user-great customer service ”
Overall: We purchased Apptivo to help with CRM and Project management. Once I get through with the initial set up (which has been no easy feat) I believe it will be a great asset.
 Customer support / MS office integration/Price
",MS office integration needs to be more robust
2019-09-11,2019,"Suitable for small businesses that don't need anything too specific”
 Overall, the platform works for what it is intended for but for businesses who operate differently than that specific parameter, it can be difficult to manipulate the apps to do what you need them to.
 The platform looks nice and easily navigatable and the customer service is wonderful. No matter how simple or difficult my request is, the person I'm working with is polite, friendly, and helpful.","All of the apps are separate so it is restricting to use information that needs to be applied across all three. Additionally, there are many small things that are not available, such as old email integration (having old emails able to be imported to email app) and not being able to bulk transfer/ import leads, customers, or contacts from one to the other. Many things have to be done individually which is difficult.
"
2019-09-06,2019,"“User-friendly, customizable CRM that can scale with us!”
 We were in so many different platforms and apps and I wanted something that could integrate with various cloud apps and automate several processes so we could do more without having to switch apps. Apptivo is very robust, yet fairly simple to configure and implement and when it wasn't simple for me, their team was right there with chat, calls, screen-sharing, whatever I needed to get the job done. Outstanding CS!
 The UI is very user-friendly, it's completely customizable for our industry specifics and the customer support has truly been world-class!
","At first, it was slow in responsiveness, but after their support team cleaned up some things for me and helped me re-configure some automations more efficiently, it's nice and quick now!
"
2019-08-27,2019,"“Exceptional Quality”
 This is the best fully customizable CRM solution we've used that integrates seamlessly with Outlook. The value for the money is exceptional.
 For the price, I haven't found anything like this out there. It is EXTREMELY customizable and the variety of apps, many of which are part of the base service package, is unbelievable.","Every now and then, there are some quirky glitches but on the positive side, client services is always available via chat and they are extremely helpful.
"
2019-08-27,2019,"“Recommended!”
 CRM, Quotations, Invoices. It has solved many of our needs. Very happy with support.
 Very flexible, full suite of business needs. Great customer support.
","Could be a bit more user-friendly regarding the many features that it offers. Explanations of what each function does.
"
2019-08-23,2019,"“Flexible but a little slow and complicated”
 Positive, still learning how we will apply it correctly but happy so far that we will be able to use it to achieve exactly what we want to.
 The flexibility of the software is great. Couldn't find any other software that can do everything we wanted.",It can be slow moving from window to window and the functionality options aren't always clear. The support is great at overcoming the second issue though
2019-08-20,2019,"“Exceptional assistance from Gowmi on recent invoice generation issue”
 Overall, the wide array of software modules and features contained within each have helped us reasonably well over the past couple years to centralize our product and client billing functions.
 Wanted to give a special thank you to Gowmi, who walked us through - and promptly adjusted templates for us relating to - a specialized case in the creation and sending of a partial payment invoice. We depend on Apptivo for most CRM functions, but we often have special case situations that need a deeper dive - and the present case was one of those. Gowmi took all of the time necessary to view my screenshots and descriptions, research the underlying problem, make changes to the templates we were using, and answered all of my follow-up questions. The problem was resolved in a timely manner, and we got the right information to our client as a result. What more can you ask for? Gowmi, thank you very much again!","We are into our 3rd year using the paid version of Apptivo. Over this period of time, we've had a moderate number of chat-based technical support issues that we've tried to resolve. Unfortunately, I've learned that if it gets to the point where the tech support team member is compelled to write a support ticket after exhausting their own team's resources, we typically never hear back again as follow-up to the ticket generation. Beyond that, admin users do not get the benefit of seeing any kind of ""Your current open support tickets and progress"" page that would give us some reassurance that tickets were actually being worked on by the senior support and developer teams. This has been a significant Achilles' heel in an otherwise very functional platform.
"
2019-08-20,2019,"“Unexpectedly good for the low price”
 We are a company from 1994 and when i took over in 2019, they were working as if it still was 1994. In a company i worked for before, it took them 10 years to find the right software. We used apptivo for a week and we knew that this was it. Now our whole business is running on it.
 The fact that the CRM and financial part work very good together.","The app on a tablet is not as extended as in the browser.
"
2019-08-15,2019,"“Exceptional Customer Service”
 I am extremely happy with Apptivo. They always go above and beyond to make Apptivo to suit their Customer's needs. I like the fact that they have Zoom so that you can screen share and talk to technical support at the same time.
 Once setup very user friendly. Love the chat feature. Always quick to respond. Love the analytic feature so that you can see the clicks and more specifically bounced responses. I like that you can edit the master layout to your specifications.","The least that I like is that once a campaign is setup you can't have it as a recurring. Example if I setup a campaign that I want to go out every January 1st - it doesn't have that capability. You have to go back in and reset the date to be sent.
"
2019-08-12,2019,"The ease of setup, in comparison to Salesforce.

","It works for 1 of the 3 things I set it up for. The user interface is not overly intuitive, its too intricate and overly complicated. It does not have a easy flow to it. It feels like trying to make a lot of pieces fit together instead of setting up steps that compliment each other.

2019-07-31,2019,"“Functional, Customize-able, Affordable, and Easy to Use Platform”
 They have been great at answering questions and helping us customize the platform to meet our specific needs. Our CRM web forms are 100% tailored to our operations. We met with nearly a dozen providers and they stood out as the best option and value by a long shot.

 We were upgrading from paper to digital and looking for an overall solution that would be CRM , Service, Production, Marketing and Apptivo covers these item well.
 This software allows our field service team the ability to write service call reports and expense reports on their phones. Additionally, the project start from kickoff to handover to service is easily tracked and the speed of the service is great. The customization implementation cost is very reasonable. Customer support via chat is fast and they provide an answer usually very quickly.

","It's sometimes hard to find things. I think this will diminish as I use the product more. The biggest frustration is the integration with other products especially O365.

2019-05-30,2019,"“Simply the Best”
 We have a business model in which we are essentially the middle-man: we have clients on one end and customers on the other, and their products go through us in-between. Apptivo allows us to easily sort who is who and what project or indication they are associated with through Tags and Categories, as well as allowing us to split contacts into Prospects, Leads, etc. In addition, we also must send out supplies from third-party vendors, so there's a lot of supply and project tracking that, ideally, we would like integrated. Apptivo has the ability to do this through automation and customization, and it is one of the cheapest options to boot! The customer service and support team is very helpful and responsive, a must for when you're starting out with a new database and have lots of questions. Highly recommend Apptivo for small businesses to track and streamline work flow.
Very accessible and great customization, easy to navigate, easy importing from Excel, ability to track email campaigns, add-on and integrate apps for parts of a process, inexpensive, and live support chat within the application

2019-05-20,2019,"Apptivo Rocks!”
 Very, very good. It is really hard to find fault. A brilliant company, very good software and a really responsive help desk that can answers questions, 24/7. What is there not to like? WELL DONE APPTIVO....(just address my two little 'cons' and you have a PERFECT platform).
 Features - This is a one stop shop. Marketing, Sales, Telephony, Shipping... the list just goes on and on. I don't there is a need to sign up to a separate subscription for other services. Apptivo has you covered for everything. Price - Amazing...so much for so little. I don't believe another platform offers such value for money. The closet is Bitrix 24, but you have to sign up for at least 5 users to use all their functionality like Google 2-way sync. So although good, not the best if you are just starting out. Customization - This app allows you to add fields, change the layout and do pretty much what you want in terms of one wishes to use it. Integration - integrates with all the major platforms and has some great 3rd party plugins. Support - 24/7 and immediate No waiting. Brilliant. Support team is particular helpful
","I think the U.I could do with a refresh Document support for uploaded files is a little limited. The software would be perfect if it had a viewer support for Word docs, etc. What this means is that any uploaded document, has to be downloaded in order to view it. This is clumsy....but a small price to pay, for what is very good software in nearly all respects.

2019-04-01,2019,"I've been using their ""Starter Plan"" since 2012. It is good enough to get by, and it is free. I mostly use the invoicing module.
"," Their software is decent, but they really seem to loathe their Starter Plan customers. The way they hack out features that they don't want available is sloppy, and makes it necessary to come up with ways to work around their intentional stumbling blocks. Apptivo - If you don't want to offer a free product, don't. I got the hint, and I'm setting up PayPal Invoicing tonight.
Certain settings in the starter plan don't make sense. For example, the e-mail template includes a link to paying online, but online payments aren't supported in the starter plan. Modifying the e-mail template to take that link out is also not supported in the starter plan. I could deal with all that, but now, after a year of using the recurring invoices feature, they suddenly stop working. The tech support person says I have to upgrade my plan to use that. But the settings pages all work, and my invoices are all just sitting there waiting.

 Very Happy with the product. It works well, year in and year out, and this year, I intend to learn how to use more aspects of it. It's a complete sales CRM and I don't really take advantage of that. I use it as an invoice generation tool. I am a loyal user and have no intention of looking elsewhere. BUT please think about that calendar feature. $60 and an invasive integration from Google, feels a bit much.
 It is easy and quick to punch out an invoice copying an old customer invoice and making a couple changes in the body the Output looks Professional when I bill my corporate clients. I like that if I get stuck, CHAT is always available and it's been quick to resolve my confusion or concerns.
","Inconsistent features access between my Ipad and my windows desktop. The IOS (Apple) apps have improved since I started using Apptivo. Although I had to have two separate Apps on my ipad initially and it was confusing, the main app has bulked up to where I rarely need to get on my windows machine. But I'm finding I do have to still, like setting up recurring invoices. Recording payments, seems to be less than intuitive, resulting in me over crediting an account and having to search until I gave up, trying to delete the twice or more extra payments due to some sort of lag from screen to screen. My man complaint is lack of a simple calendar capability and it appears if I want it I'll be having to add Google G Suites, which is overkill. Apparently to make up for lack of feature capability in Apptivo, if I want to set up recurring invoices that utilize date features like 2nd Tuesday of every month or 4th Monday of the month. That will cost me $6 month from Google and I don't want or need all of the G suite features.

 Fastastic experience overall. Great documentation but I just use the chat support and they usually direct you straight to the article I need. I intend to gradually introduce all the functionallity into my business.
 I like the way you can enable just the bits you need. I started with just invoicing and am gradually enabling the other elements as I need them. That way it doesnt blind you with too many options whilst you learn to use the system. Its the support that really makes the difference in this product. I have had lots of questions and I have all these answered quickly via the chat function. No question is too much trouble and considering the very affordable price its unbelievable.

 Support is trying very hard to address the challenges and I'm confident they will find a solution. We're going to give them 90 days before looking elsewhere. Overall, I feel that Apptivo can be a HUGE player in the Business Management arena as long as they work the bugs out and make it more friendly API wise. Would love to see it fully integrated with RingCentral so that we don't have to pay PieSync to do the integration, etc.
 The software offers a solution to every business management challenge - EXCEPT SCHEDULING. They have a wonderful platform and I'm confident their users will find it valuable once the bugs are worked out.
","Thre are a lot of bugs that cause the platform to not perform as intended. Double work is needed to overcome the challenges of buggy software so that's not an ideal situation. Seems to work better on Chrome than any other browser but not everyone HAS Chrome.

2019-02-20,2019," We are a small & medium company located in Europe with subsidiaries in US and Asia. We were looking for a provider which could (1) allow each subsidiary to view each other's customers (to increase the lead generation); (2) enable us to standardize our data (previously we were entering data into Excel without proper format); (3) facilitate data analysis and (4) enable us to streamline and automatize as much as possible the process from price offer to invoicing. After extensive research, we selected Apptivo for our CRM solution. Having to deal with lots of lists of companies from different countries, dealing with multiple currencies, it was not easy to find a CRM which is easy to use, affordable and yet can meet our demand. We have been using Apptivo for one year now and we are very happy with our choice. It was a necessary step to professionalize our business process. There is probably much more we can do with the application which we haven't explore yet. We are now using CRM, HR, Suppliers, items and Invoicing app within Apptivo.
 Easy to use, flexible, great value for money, great support (very friendly and quick), easy to import/export your data back into Excel.
","We found a few small glitches (no space between ""Mr."" and ""Name"" when exporting the fields; or one functionality in invoicing did not work), but the support team was very quick in fixing those.

 I have only used a handful of the features so far, however, I am happy with what I have, I was looking for a solution like this as I grow but don't have the resources to generate a custom solution. This was the perfect fit, it hosts all the information of expense reports, projects, invoicing, licensing, provider payments, staffing, etc. in one place to review so things don't get lost through the cracks.
You can find many CRM softwares, other project management softwares, and yet other accounting software. Apptivo brings all these features and more into one platform. While maybe not the easiest to use, it is due to the vast capabilities and customization features of the software. I don't have an IT staff and am an individual business owner but I was able to get everything set up for my professional services related business. I am extremely satisfied with the fast assistance by email, phone, and chat with the support staff, I couldn't have done it without them.

 It helps to manage customer relationship, campaigns, billing, and invoices. This is helpful to manage payment and tax department very smoothly which is important for any business. It further helps to organize the calendar for all business activities and keep a record of all the important contact details. Document management is another key feature. All the important documents related to the business can be kept safely in a virtual location. It caters to widespread businesses like the travel industry, retail, and wholesale industry etc..

I have been hindered in learning how to use other apps within Apptivo because I don't want to go through the hassle of dealing with customer support.
 Apptivo provides an excellent CRM for us to schedule emails and send a personalized email to several people at the same time. We schedule meeting reminder emails and workshop reminder emails all through Apptivo.
","Customer support is lacking and the software is not very intuitive. It seems as though customer support is outsourced and that the CSR's don't know the product very well. Apptivo does not have a lot of instructional videos on Youtube and their written support is hard to locate.

2018-06-20,2018,"Apptivo is All-Inclusive, Modern ERP Cloud App Done Right (Just Add Speed and GUI Refresh)”
 I was using Teamwork (formerly Teamwork PM) for project management, a local install of vTiger CRM for contacts and opportunity management, and myriad other cloud-based apps to pull together administrative activities. I wanted an all-inclusive software with strong project management features that also allowed me to handle detailed invoicing and allowed customers to click a link to pay. Lastly, the CRM component had to be at least as good as vTiger (or Zoho CRM which I'd also given a trial run). Apptivo satisfied these needs. Pleased with the CRM, opportunity management, project management, field service management, and billing apps (especially since they've added Stripe as a payment gateway).
 They do not nickle-and-dime you to death! One price includes everything. Their tiers are about number of users rather than adding/subtracting features. A more sensible model than some of the others. I like how detail views are available from most places -- call logs, projects, tasks, and notes can be associated with a contact or company or opportunity. The integration with email is excellent, right down to making it easy to connect your email boxes. One challenge I had that Apptivo solved for me was how to keep emails related to a particular project or opportunity all together in one place. Apptivo does a good job of this by assigning codes (or project numbers), and allowing you to select whether or not the email you are writing is related. If you are writing emails using some other application (your desktop client or cloud-based app), you can use the same code in the subject line and Apptivo will pull that email into the app, and associate it with the relevant modules (project, client, case, etc.)
","Apptivo is reliable, doesn't seem to ever lose information, etc. but it is often as slow as molasses in an ice storm. Waiting is a no-no; constant waiting is a annoyance that has made me close the app more than once and come back another time. Apptivo communicates improvements and changes on a regular basis, however, it takes Apptivo a long, loooooong time to integrate changes that have been requested by clients, and improvements overall. The incremental changes they report on are good but they are really things that should have been implemented 4-5 years ago. An example of this is Stripe (payment gateway) integration. I requested it over and over about 3 years ago but it was just implemented last year. They could do better with customization (esp. dashboards), reporting, data import, data export and speed. Low scores on API/integrations -- they have an API but not many other services have developed integrations for it. Neither have they developed many integrations (except for Google products). Even their WordPress module is outdated, clunky. Also, connection to phone services (to take better advantage of the ability to log calls). The interface still has areas that are clunky and unattractive (although, in defense of Apptivo, I must say the interface has improved in aesthetics, colors and icons in the 4 years I've been using it).
"
2018-06-17,2018,"Good project tracker”
 I like that it's simple enough to set up and tailor to my business' needs. I don't use it myself, but mobile app is convenient should you need to use it.

 You have a clear vision of all the processes in a company ready to be analyzed

","At the beginning of the implementation phase, effectiveness may decrease if there is resistance to sharing information among commercial units or departments, this depends on the skill and ability of the work force, it also implies education and training, even though this tool is very easy to use and very intiutive for the team work so it can be less this training time

 I can adapt it to my needs. I feel that when I make a suggestion for improvement it will genuinely be listened to.
","There are a lot of bugs - this is why I have marked the overall quality down. We are always creating something and then it crashes, or it wont save and we have to start again. Or emails never arrive which causes big problems. Whenever there are updates, something unintentional seems to get affected. Perhaps more testing before going live. It feels a bit unprofessional sometimes. We can't test our own changes, so when I am updating things and people are using it, it can be disruptive. I really need to make changes and test before going live. The support is not always perfect. Some times its great, but sometimes I am not understood. The right intentions are always there though.

2018-05-14,2018,"All-in-one ERP - broad coverage at a reasonable price”
 All-in-one business software, good support and value for the money.
 An extremely broad range of applications. Apptivo beats most competitors in this respect; it really is an 'all-in-one' ERP in fact - not just a CRM. At the same time Apptivo is excellent value for the money. The 'in-app' live chat support is especially helpful, as you can deal with issues as they occur. The pricing is per user, broadening the base of potential organizations who will find Apptivo appealing from the outset, and scaling as the organization grows larger.
","Being a 'jack of all trades', Apptivo cannot be expected to excel in every area. Some features - such as the two Wordpress plugins - seem neglected and are seldom updated or promoted. Given the popularity of WP it seems to be a missed opportunity to expand into the help desk market. Another example would be the customer portal, it seems a bit awkward. The customer must sign-up through Xinnect and then Apptivo as well to access their portal, even though Apptivo might not be relevant to them. It is also difficult to control exactly what clients will see, and they are shown a lot of irrelevant fields, even though there is a rudimentary role assignment mechanism. Combining this with cases (tickets) and answers (knowledge-base) should in theory provide an alternative to a help desk, but it is a long way round.

","Invoicing is very basic. Not able to use it if you bill hourly. Not enough 1:1 support for highly complex project system setups. Need more reps to have access to custom care. Had pitfalls in reporting, but were addressed fairly quickly, but set us back as a company. Needing to double check items saved in the project you just updated, some data doesn't get saved on the first try. Not being made aware of when enhancements are made and what new features now exist.

We are not paying for the service (so I guess we don't have the right to complain) but it has been an issue to trouble-shooting the problems. Customer support has been responsive but resolution of the issues has sometimes been slower than I'd like. I've had to create work-arounds to resolve some of the issues.
"
2018-05-07,2018,"Great value and functionality for the money!”
 Ability to track many aspects of my business with ease.
 I like that I can customize the CRM to fit my specific needs. It give me many options for capturing data that I need to keep track of my business. I like the ability to be able to filter reports and keep track of revenue.
","I wish I had the ability to mass delete information. It is very time consuming to delete each record one at a time.
"
2018-05-07,2018,"Like that I can access from a mobile device”
 Mobile access in a easy to use format.... just need eda simple contact management program where daily notes and quotations can be stored.... Don't need or want the fluff that doesn't help sell products for our organization...
 Quick connections - no hang time...format is easy to follow, learning curve is very quick and help chat is a huge plus.....Mobile device connect is seamless , even on a smart phone
","Adding contacts individuals - address and main phone numbers are not migrated from the Company of at lease the option.......
"
2018-05-07,2018,"I am happy with the service as it meets my requirements”
 I needed a CRM system that I could import existing data and then also create campaigns. I also wanted quite granular segmentation capabilities. I started with the free version and after a few days went for the paid option as I wanted to do some customization. For the price I think the service is very comprehensive and when I have asked for support it's been helpful and met my requirements. There are modules / components that I have not yet used but I like knowing they are there if I need them. The product video's online are very helpful. I should have started with them so some mistakes where made.","I often want to set up a calendar entry in different outlook mailboxes. Ideally I want to copy an address associated with a contact. However when I click on the address to copy and paste into outlook calendar the option take me into edit mode which take me longer to copy and paste as I have to copy a few times. Otherwise I have no other issues.
"
2018-05-05,2018,"Central to my operation”
 Apptivo does everything that I need for my business. It's simple to configure and has all the functionality essential for my business. I like its completeness and how all the modules are integrated
","The mobile app is very limited and does not have the functionality of the web app. For a small business that operates on the go this is not ideal
"
2018-05-05,2018," I like the fact that I can tailor Apptivo to my company needs. It also, allows me to add invoicing plus more as I need it.
","The software is very very very slow when going from customer to customer. I hate I am not able to link the apps together by person once new app is created.
"
2018-05-05,2018,"Pretty good”
 Crm at a reasonable price
 Value for price and its functionality with other programs. I like how its compatible with the other programs I use like Google and wordpress
","Support. I inquired about wordpress plugin and had the articles sent to me but ran into issues and rep said someone would call me back but didnt

2018-05-05,2018,"It is a Plug-n-play CRM ,ready to use software for initial startups.”
 Recording instances on one place
 The CRM integration with Gsuite is very good .And the CRM and Product management app is very good and any startup can rely on it for these features.
","Financial apps - due to lack of Indian system compatible features,Indian Tax system incompatibility , Lack of Indian payment gateway integration. and Cases app . And Android app - which fails many times to record call logs and send messages.( Not trustworthy by Android app). E-commerce WordPress integration is so poor that do not compete with other e-commerce platforms Outside web application Integration is very tough ,so can't be used for larger purpose.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Very easy to get up to speed.”
 The technical support is great and the dashboard function is a big help and better than what any competitor has to offer.
","There is not a starter tutorial that covers everything and you are sort of left on your own to get up to speed.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"A great and very customizable CRM with easy integration with our email server”
 Very easy integration with gmail extension. Auto-fill on retrievable customer data. High level of customization of the fields.
","Terrible ecommerce integration unless using shopify. The fixed or default fields cannot be removed or hidden
"
2018-05-04,2018,"I was reluctant in the start but since I've started using it, I must say it's one of the best.”
 One of the best softwares that one can find in the market to download and get on with using it without any issues.
","I haven't found any to date but as soon as I find them will surely update my review. I haven't seen the option of the received amount in the software or maybe I haven't explored it yet.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Works well for the most part and is geared towards retailers or service providers. ”
 The ability to link contacts and sub-organizations across a parent company and cross-reference orders.
 Easy to use across most apps in a retail or service environment, the ability to see notes, contacts, and links from past orders.","Emails frequently get blacklisted and blocked by corporate and government spam/security filters. Poorly designed for manufacturing or ERP use.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"exceptionally customizable ”
 New workflow and campaign management tool
 its customizable solution for all your needs is what I love the most. It is very Affordable and provides 24-hour support. They have the beautiful mobile app which is very easy to use.
","Integration with third party application is something they need more homework. they don't have much app that integrates.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Not bad fir the price”
 Price is good. It works well for invoicing once it is configured properly. Would recommend this for a small business.
","The email feature is not very user friendly and the interface is a bit confusing at first. Customer support could be better.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Able to run n my whole business within a single app. ”
 No lost opportunities, better tracking and follow up. Everything within a single application and more presentable documentation.
 Turning a lead into a contact, into a customer, into an opportunity. Create a quote, with all the customer info in minutes from my built-in pricing.
","I would like to be able to convert a quote into an invoice with the ability to modify as needed to add items and edit.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Started using Apptivo 3 years ago, Great financial admin tools and smartphone apps are handy as well”
 Cloud based, User friendly and if you require something they will try to add it in. 24/7 live customer support.
","You can do a print out of all payments received if you have many clients (per invoice only), time sheets will only be specified on the invoices if you do it one week at the time.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"I've been using this software for 2 years. Feels good”
 Inexpensive
 Integration to offer apps. We use RingCentral to make and track calls. We also use the email function
","The support is tedious. They prefer a chat format that takes 3 - 5 minutes before they respond to a question. Almost always they ask the same questions over and over. Support is over seas
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Really easy to use and helpful to our goals!”
 I love the way we can easily streamline our contacts across employees. Apptivo was easy to use and a great solution.
","Adding new contacts was sometimes time consuming with multiple tabs, but once you got the hang of it it was ok.
"
2018-05-04,2018," Helped me to organize my client list. Forced me to get all the info for clients into one app. It also worked well for my other team members.
 Lots of features for a low price. There are many options in the software for keeping track of sales, invoicing, subscriptions, and files. There is a feature for just about everything.
","The program has tones of feature but is a bit slow and needs to be modernized” The program is slow and not organized well. It needs to be streamlined. It is doing way too much for my needs and that gets in the way.

"
2018-05-04,2018," The Flex ability, create way to have all customers, estimates, invoices all in one central place. Would like to see more features like Housecall Pro.

"
2018-05-04,2018,"I have been using Apptivo for 5 years now. Very good overall!”
: Integration, control over my process, paper reduction, information available always, on the go, basic reporting, personalization and company branding, professional presentation of my company, cost control,
 Simple It is growing in terms of features It allows managing a complete end-to-end company Invoicing App is very simple and powerful. Mobile app works fine
","Sometimes it is slow Some Apps are very basic Documentation is very simple, basically the screenshots Personalization could be complex
"
2018-05-04,2018,"I like that it is easily customizable and new users were able to learn it quickly. I love that we could customize it for alerts/reminders for our service customers warranty expirations. It has eliminated a lot of dual entry our previous system had.
","Customizing the forms was difficult and there are still a few things on our forms that are less than perfect but overall am happy with them.
"
2018-05-04,2018,"Apptivo helps to keep my partner and I organized. We particularly use the email and notes function. We are a builder, so everything is organized around projects. The scheduling program is terrible, by the way.
 The concept of the software is great... it is very integrated and it seems like the owners are always trying to improve the program.","I like Apptivo, but have found it to have lots of glitches and is very slow at times” The problems are the number of glitches experienced; the difficulty in getting issues resolved; the fact that the program can be very slow to respond. Right now, for instance, when I click on an email sometimes it opens up and sometimes it doesn't. Not sure what is causing this, but it is extremely frustrating and inefficient. I tend to do things in Google. I am seriously considering abandoning Apptivo.
"
2018-05-03,2018,"We recently started to use it. So far, so good”
 Can access all areas of our business - Sales, Projects, Tasks etc. I like the ability to create Project Templates
","We have to create Custom Lists for common views like Opportunities > Open> Sorted by close date. A pretty common KPI. We then have to export it just to view it on a weekly basis for staff meeting. A few steps to get standard data. Same with Open Projects, sorted by Due Date
"
2018-05-03,2018,"Brilliant Software with Fair Pricing”
 I use the CRM daily to enable our business to run smoothly.
 Very good feature set with lots of modules. Possible to even create custom apps / integrations. Mobile apps are very good. Support is brilliant - Live Chat is built in to the CRM.
","Some times there are little bugs that can appear e.g. the text changes font/size when typing which can be annoying. Sometimes it can be a little slow.
"
2018-05-02,2018,"A lot of configuration, but once you learn the dynamics and functionality it becomes more simple.”
 How organized the applications are and all apps are cohesive with each other. I like the trigger function as well.
","Need more than just a couple demos to fully understand the functionality of Apptivo. It takes a while to research through the settings of each app for what I specifically wanted, especially for my employees.
"
2018-05-02,2018,"The versatility of Apptivo is great for me because I use it for multiple businesses.”
 Organization. Meeting deadlines. Tracking customer interaction. Easy invoicing.
 I like being able to customize a lot of different items and use it for different purposes. I can keep track of customers and make sure I'm hitting my deadlines. The invoicing is easy and professional.
","The interface is a little bit lacking. It seems outdated and not very attractive. It's a little bit cumbersome to find a customer. The loading times can be a little bit slow.
"
2018-05-02,2018,"Great Software + Great Support + Very expandable”
 It has disciplined my sales team
 It does exactly what I need for my start up business but also has shown the capability to expand as my business has grown.
","Nothing. It's a great app for our busiess and there's a lot of other providers whose functionality is limited but costs much much more.
"
2018-05-02,2018,"Awesome way to house my clients. ”
 I am able to add customers to the database and then go back in and update their charts from any location that I am at. I love it.
 What I like most about Apptivo is the calendar for scheduling my clients and how the CRM software makes it easy to navigate to the clients uploaded files.
","I wish that we could eliminate the am hours that shows up on the calendar. I have tried to figure out how to eliminate like 1am to 7 am.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Best service we started with when starting our company. very intuitive.”
total control over my business contacts, and invoicing system.
 Ease of use and the cost is minimal compared to the features you are getting in the package. Invoicing feature is excellent as well.
","A little slow when for example creating an invoice and sending to customer. The actual customer, business relationship is confusing when adding contacts and companies.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Great Support and A Wide Variety of Capabilities”
 It's simple to set up, straightforward to use. Many features that in other systems are ""enterprise-only"" are available to all users. The support team is ALWAYS available by chat with quick and straightforward answers.
","Some of the features I really looked forward to had been deprecated. Integration with Office 365 at this point is just a kludge mail option that has Aptivo mail as a passive receiver of email -- not a real 2-way IMAP client. No direct people sync exists for O365, and there's not yet an IFTT or Zapier connection (although there IS a robust API published).
"
2018-05-01,2018,"I have used it for months splendidly. I'm in real estate so I do wish the properties was better” I'm in a small organization so prices was the main consideration

","it worked good for a while until I figured out the commercial real estate was not practical. the properties module is not intuitive for commercial brokerage real estate. it seems the programmers considered residential only.

"
2018-05-01,2018,"I have utilized several CRM solutions and the Apptivo CRM solution is a great solution for it's cost”
 Apptivo CRM is easy to use, and makes available lots of functionality to pick and choose from when building a customized solution. Apptivo's customer support is excellent, responsive, helpful and does a great job supporting me when I need help.
","For non-technical users, modifying the screens to build a customized app, can be a challenge. However, Apptivo customer service is ready to jump in and help when needed. Customer support is accomplished via chat window, which can be tedious. However, Apptivo makes available voice support when requested. And, they provide lots of You-Tube based videos to demonstrate how to modify functionality.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Best Bang for the buck on the market! Adaptability and ease of use with scalability!”
 Functionality and accurate data collection that was flexible to meet my needs! Hands down the best solution on the market for the price point!
 Ease of USE and layout modifications! The layout is so easy and adaptable to collect the information simply from other users. Databases are only as good as the information you put into them. Apptivo makes it so SIMPLE getting the info in and thus making it powerful!
","Very few, because it is cloud-based they are constantly adding customization features and options and sometimes the functional icons show up in the Customization Settings of the Administrator and there is no documentation for the new functionality as of yet. I would much rather have this problem than them not update the customization functionality though. This database is unbelievably scalable and constantly improving!
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Apptivo has been able to provide me with anything I needed to do to manage and invoice customers”
 i'm able to keep leads, contacts and customers straight. I can easily see where I can gather more clients.
 Online -easily accessible Intuitive interface Has all the features of larger, more expensive software
","UI for invoices used to be straightforward but has changed. Reminders and recurring tasks could be easier to set up.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"We found something affordable that met our current need.
 The uploading contacts portion was easy to use. When I had questions the representative was helpful.
",It was difficult at first deciding how we wanted our dashboard to look but over time we figured it o” To do custom fields was tricky. I would have email a presentative and sometimes it was difficult getting quick solutions.
2018-05-01,2018,"Good, customizable CRM-system with lots of functions. Extreme good value money-vise.”
 That it's logical and give you the possibility to customize it however you want, plus that it gives you a good value for your money.
","Maybe the look of the program. Looks a little bit of old-school and not very fresh. I do think it would attract mote people if it were more eye-cathing.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Easy to set up and get a team going soonest.”
 Ease of use, ease of set up and getting a team on-board...
 Cost and ease of use, that app store is also awesome. Easy to track Opportunities and has a great reporting function.
","It took me a while to figure out how to do tax and territories, but the support team is awesome, and we soon had it sorted.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Using the program to track all customers and use for email blast”
 easy to use within its own program. Has many more features than we would ever need to use. Would be great if you could dispatch from the program
","does not integrate with constant contact without a lot of additional work. We have spent a lot of time on the phone and using chat to try and correct but no easy way as of now. Needs to have the first and last name separated on the CRM customer app
"
2018-05-01,2018,"it has been very good. ”
 time management, organization, piece of mind
 ease of use, phone app prompts you to record to leave note. I also like the notes within the task and then how all of the notes fall under the one client
","cant sort customers based on multiple tags. If for example I wanted all of my clients that liked golf and were in zip code 46074. I cant sort for that.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Very useful CRM, accessible from anywhere, good value for money”
 The CRM functionality is intuitive to use. Not much setup is needed but still a lot of customization is possible. It can easily grow with the company and is accessible from anywhere. As a cloud based service you do not need to care about hardware, accessibility etc. Remarkable: There is an exceptionally responsive customer support. Overall very recommended for flexible startup companies.
","While the CRM functionality is quite good the rest of the apps (like order management, invoicing, inventory etc.) are a bit limited in possibilities and use. As long as one is dealing within a single country this should be fine. As an international business with export to many countries there will be many compromises or workarounds. Especially regarding interaction with the customers (quotes, invoices etc.) the customization possibilities are very limited. From time to time new releases or features are deployed that can change appearance and functionality to the better or worse. While the response time of the customer support is better than anything else I have ever seen, the help with more sophisticated questions is often limited and needs long explanations. Fixing of bugs can take very long. Overall the software feels a bit slow.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"There are no software solutions that provide everything to everyone...but this one is close”
 Keeps us well organized and tracking towards are monthly sales goals
 Tracking Sales Opportunities and keeping all information in one place. It even has a document depository which is quite helpful in sharing information.
","The social media monitoring in the CRM feature is lacking or non existent. There are plenty of insites that can be gained by looking at a potential customer's LinkedIn account
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Software is great. Able to create a customized template that works for my company
 How customizable it is. It feels like it's my personal software specifically designed for my company's needs. And all the different app you have.
","There a handle of very basic things that have need to be addressed. There are very basic things that have never been addressed. For example, the Company Name field in google contacts does not sync with Apptivo. So if I put a company name in the google contact nothing comes over to apptivo. Also, you can't schedule a reoccuring event on the calendar, why? I come across silly stuff like this all the time.

"
2018-05-01,2018,"Relatively easy”
 Organization, ease of locating contacts
 The organization of the software is great with a lot of ways to track your contacts and when you contact them.
","It tends to be slow while working within the contacts. I would like to delete the names of categories that I am not using. I would like to be able to pull a monthly receipt for reconciliation purposes.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Webform capturing data, and offering automated quotes.
 Price and the breadth of the published feature set. Accessing those features is another issue, however. If an administrator was dedicated to set things up and use Apptivo's consulting services for 3+ months, feature accessibility and the overall user experience may be different
","They need to figure out how to make the software simpler and more productive out of the box. It's really hard to use, as they haven't yet implemented an out-of-the-box solution that's easy and straightforward. It's almost like a kit that an IT staff would need to spend 3+ months setting up before deploying it.

"
2018-05-01,2018,"Amazing streamline”
 Beautiful layout, tutorial videos to get you started, chats with agents who answer your questions pretty much instantly.
","Some API difficutlies. Some difficulty with the email syncing in the beginning. Email opened receipt sometimes lags by a long time.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Really liked the way emails were tagged, tracked and seemed easy to find or follow at any point in the sales cycle. ","Liked the product but wasnt crazy about the lack of resources or ability to find help. support and ability to learn on ones own time. Felt like I had to figure out how to use or develop many of the features. Not a fan of not having folders in main email inbox.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Great Value and Customer Service”
 Great CRM/invoicing for a start up, single-operator health based business.
 I was able to get it set up and running fairly quickly and was able to get customer support when needed. Customer service was super friendly...I was particularly impressed because I called during my free trial and they treated me like a paying customer.
","When I first signed up (2014), it was missing some features that other more, robust CRM/Inventory management software offered, such as an app to manage it and specific reporting. I understand they have added additional features since I first signed up.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"I have been using Apptivo for several years; they have great features but can run slowly.”
 An affordable CRM program that integrates with invoices, and paymentss. Great customer support.
 integration between CRM and invoicing and emailing is great! I am able to send out invoices and get paid through PayPal and my system is updated.
","The software can be slow. Sometimes I will input information and the program does not respont. They offer a Ledger to input expenses but it is very difficult to use, takes such a long time to update. Overall some areas are great but the program lags, takes a very long time to upload info.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"For the money, the level of functionality can't be beat. And the system is designed to be flexible enough to meet almost any use case scenario.","The software is very flexible, but slow and can be cumbersome to configure.”The software is slow to use, taking quite some time to refresh screens. Not devastating slow, but more of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario; where each little hesitation adds up to a noticable reduction in productivity. Also, with extreme flexibility there is always the tradeoff of extensive configuration; and Apptivo is no exception in that regard. The more you use, the more you will need to configure. In the end, none really. The tradeoff of performance for price and flexibility was not worth it.


"
2018-05-01,2018,"Easy to use, few quirks but Apptivo CS is willing to help. Can easily add and removed functions. ”
 Very simple to roll out, after a few informational sessions on the product was easy to get things started. Apptivo CS helped make tweaks as we moved forward. Cost effective for small businesses.
","Biggest issue we have had so far was the migration from Saleforce, had a few hick ups regarding the data, took awhile to get it figured out. Once it was imported we had to do alot of back ground work to find data we needed.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Easy to start using. Fast support. ”
 The price is right, the ux is intuitive and I like the flexibility of adding just the apps that I need.
","It's hard to know the best way to do a particular task since there maybe more than one way of getting there between apps & I'd like a refresher on designing a campaign.
"
2018-05-01,2018,-,"slow, ineffective ""chat"". 2nd & 3rd levels of support take a week or more to respond, then are tot”
 a glorified rolodex (sometimes)
 very little because the issues we had with email syncing and marketing emails far outweigh the problems
 emails lost inside the apptivo black hole, show to be sent but never get to the internet. slow response to every issue, large or small. email blast process is worthless and seldom works.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Amazingly deep feature set, more than most will need. 
 Amazing amounts of features. The way the software integrates all together is quite amazing. Can't imagine any small to medium business needing more. Intuitive, if not easy to use.
","Not exciting, fun, or enjoyable to use. We just found that we were not using the product. It was very generic, not especially well laid out, and just not that easy to setup."
2018-05-01,2018,"all in all good software. Helps out my small business keep organized.”
 keeps everything where we can access it all, links well with google apps. keeps track of start to finish work orders
","it won't sync with quickbooks after multiple calls and emails to tech support. It looks like it works with the UK version of QB.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"It works”
Pros: Customization (to an extent). We are able to make it fit our needs for a very niche business. The mobile app works well.
","Support is difficult to reach and not very responsive. Some things like the email sync with Gmail don't seem to work that well.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"I use it for my career counseling business”
 It can track almost everything I need tracked - ie., customer information, invoices, scheduling, payment,
","Ease of use - I feel it is not completely user friendly. The gui is difficult to figure out and there are not enough links. Also, it is not easy to manipulate a screen or generate a personalized report.
"
2018-05-01,2018,The Support staff were helpful and available. It was easy to use and the features were nice options.,"It didn't have all the features we needed but they were working on it.  You had to add the same information each time you added an app, this made it time consuming. Such as Templates for Email, I had to add it to the Email section, the Customer Section and then again to the Contacts section. It would have been nice to have a Universal Email template area so I could input them Once and choose throughout. Also, some functions for the Funnel system and Search engine wouldn't be Universal enough, so I had copies of people in each section so I could do a search or Report in 2 different areas for One customer just to get the complete information I needed. Search, and Reports should have the same options regardless of where the Customer is a Lead or transferred into a Buyer. This was annoying.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Apptivo is what you pay for, the team is responsive and it's easy to navigate. ”
 I found an app that was affordable and got the job done. It's not perfect, but they work hard to resolve any issues that do arise. The live chat feature is probably my favorite.
 I like it's flexibility and how easy it is to customize. The invoicing software works well with the client and customer functions as well.
","At times, I'm frustrated by the amount of bugs that there are. Eventually you learn to work around them, but I do find it tedious to deal with at times.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Immediate, chat help is outstanding. Great customer service!”
 Robust set of tools....highly customizable....more than I will ever need. I also like the integration with Office365. I like the idea that this is a set of tools that I can ""grow into...""
","No MS Word Integration for easily writing snail-mail letters is a the biggest con and a terrible oversight. Plenty of businesses still send letters, for goodness sakes! Also, SMS messaging should be available in the web app to make typing easier.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"I do like the prompt chat service”
 I am able to have a easy to use CRM
 I enjoy having access to apptivo through the app on my phone. I feel the information is laid out well and easily accessible","I use the notes a lot under the contacts, there is often a delay in opening up the dialog box and I have to click several times to open the notes and add content"
2018-05-01,2018,"Overall pretty good”
 Easy access. I like being able to access all our customer info from anywhere. I can get help if I need it, although sometimes what I need to get done gets lost in translation with the tech support people.
 It is available anywhere I am. I am able to access my account from anywhere and get answers for my coworkers whenever they need them.
","It takes me forever to do certain things. Too many hoops to jump through to make it do the easy things I am asking for
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Overall, we are winning with Apptivo! ”
The ability to modify each app is amazing. This allows us to create what best fits our customers needs.
","There isn't enough options to create a visually modern layout. Layout options are limit. I would definitely like the ability to implement different color schemes or utilize different font options.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"My team and I found Apptivo very easy to use and integrate into our dialy routine. ”
 I love the flexibility when creating a project workflow. Everything we need is there. Set it once and forget it.
", I think the thing I like least is the sterile and gray look of the software. Wish we could customize for color.
2018-05-01,2018,"Very intuitive sales tool to use”

","I haven't discovered anything that I like the least about this software or the applications of it. I'm only using CRM, Marketing, Human Resources, Supplier."

"
2018-05-01,2018,Everything in one place. But the app didn't work like it should. I think it's great and tried hard to use it well but to no avail. I like that I could keep it all right there. One thing effects 5 others,"Great concept but it doesn't work well. Really hard to use, lots of things didn't work. Difficult to setup. Input everything that I should have but it didn't work. I called customer service but didn't get any where
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Simple, cost effective and somewhat customizable. The interface is straightforward, and the app is pretty user friendly. A simple, clean alternative to salesforce.
","Overall, basic functionality is solid. Customization and depth of UX is lacking.” Support is bad-- language barrier. Has many functions that I simply don't use. I am in commercial real estate and some of the sales cycle tools simply do not apply
"
2018-05-01,2018,"I like the amount of different ways that this software could be utilized, and thought it was a cost effective product.","I felt the software was not intuitive for our needs and was not designed for our particular needs. It was too complex to setup and I felt that the software moved slowly, lacking user-friendliness.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Apptivo is a good product. I think it has a good design and the ease of use is refreshing.”
 Organizing of all contacts and the ability to track data.
 That its modular and can be increased in size and functionality like a Lego set. It accommodates many industries as a result and seems to have thought of nearly everything regarding CRM in business.
",Just the lack in a bit more customization for our use in the financial industry. Some of the fields I would like to change and add maybe other widgets or tools somewhat reflected in Word Press so we don';t have to go outside the software.
2018-05-01,2018,"Works very well.”
 Ease of use and ability to customize to fit our business model. I like being able to customize my screen to only use/see what i need.
","mobile app doesn't do everything the web-based platform does. Also, it may be my computer, but it takes a little time to load each section.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Does what it says it will do. Has the ability to sort and tag, create targeted lists. Good search functionality","Overly complex for a small business. Learning curve is steep if small business. It is overconfigured, tries to be all things for all purposes
"
2018-05-01,2018,"My Field employees use apptivo daily to conduct business and are satisfied overall ”
 Visibility into the field, ease of invoicing customers on the fly.
 The invoicing feature integrated with quickbooks is the most beneficial to our business. I like the customer management but I find it a bit confusing sometimes.","The overall layout of the website. I am familiar with it and I find it still takes me a long time to get to certain places like account features, etc to change settings.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Good software that does a lot but lacks some basic features”
 Easy to use. The screens were easy to navigate, the flexible interface was good. It made for a smooth operation.
","There were some basic features missing that I believe are still in the making. I was unable to sort out leads based on when they were entered, some simple math operators were missing (less than, more than, equals to) etc. Other than that, the package is quite nice and well thought of.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Everything has been going very well!!”
 Everything was already setup. We really didn't have to change too much in order to us to have success with the platform.
","There is some functionality with the converting process that I wish was better but we have been able to get by.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Brilliant, affordable CRM that takes a bit of getting used to!”
 Enterprise CRM for a very affordable price.
 It's affordable and scales with the increase in users, it's Cloud Based, lot's of features, Instant Support Chat within the CRM is 100% amazing, Plenty of Apps, Custom features as well.
","Can be slow at times, Difficult to get going and understand how the system works. Little bugs are noticeable e.g. typing information in a box can suddenly disappear when saving etc. Tip is is Select All, Copy, then save - if it wipes what you types then just paste back in the box.
"
2018-05-01,2018,"Generally good with several very frustrating features”
 Can store all of our contacts in the same place as opportunities.
 Sales funnel and sales tools combined with the potential for invoices/shipping/etc also included. Differentiation between contacts and customers helps streamline project work.
","No way of automatically updating contact details on contacts by changing details on customers, editing contacts/customers becomes quite laborious. Cant delete suppliers."
2018-04-24,2018,"Excellent tool to generate projects as well as the sales process”
 This tool is very useful to evaluate and organize the entire sales process that a company has with its products or services, it also has application for the phone and works very well
","It is a bit expensive as most applications but you can pay, since its use value is at a good price, its interface may improve over time
"
2018-04-24,2018,"Great product but prefer other services. ”
 
 The high hopes that we had were met but ended up going with another product. We liked the concept provided, the workflow, and the price point. You will definitely be happy with this product if you choose it.
","Use was easy but could have had more. I can see this being costly for some companies depending on their expenditures. Also, an updated interface would be nice.
"
2018-04-04,2018,"A different option”
 I can keep many different items together such as inventory building materials projects products etc etc in one place and although I can access it on the go it is limited to what I can actually get to from the app.
 I love that there are multiple options that you can set to your requirements you can set up any number of items that are connected such as projects CRM expenses inventory and a host of other things and makes it really flexible and customizable.
","It is a bit too difficult to navigate and takes a little bit of learning to get used to it I'm still getting acquainted with the program and have had difficulty syncing the calendar and tasks which is a bit of a bummer because those are things that I really did need to have available to me however that's minor.
"
2018-04-04,2018,"Integrate help in your apps
 It is really nice how effortlessly you can integrate a helpdesk in your apps. It supports both iOS and Android and looks pretty good in both versions. The paid version brings a few nice reports and integrations, which the free version misses.
","It can be a bit pricey for small companies. Besides, some of the integrations don't' work perfectly, there can be issues with emails and reports. Other than that it is a really nice way to provide customer support right from your app.
"
2018-03-27,2018,"Superb”
 Saving my time on invoicing.
 Free version provides a lot of functionality and the paid is very reasonable. Single product to manage all your CRM, Leads, Project Management, Time Billing, Invoicing, HelpDesk and more. Great support too and proactive bug fixes.
",It would be great the user interface can be made modern as it is bit cluttered. I can't fault anything else.
2018-03-04,2018,"Apptivo - Get what you pay for”
 Apptivo is a good price without signing annual membership. It is also fairly easy, ONCE it is set up. Apptivo offers a nice clean Mobile app, again, ONCE it is set up.
","Continuous email syncing issues - even with common G-Mail applications. Email app very difficult to use. Primary use - good for organizing once synced. App offers many features - but they do not flow from one app to another. For example, set up tags on the customer page, but tags are lost when building an opportunity for that same customer. If you want the tags, you need to re-enter on the opportunity page.
"
2018-02-13,2018,"The price compared to competitors is very affordable. The software is very customizable. Service team was quick to respond to issues.
","Not fully baked CRM,. Seems like many features weren't totally integrated or well fleshed out. We had many issues importing our existing contacts over.
"
2018-02-09,2018,"Customizable solution, solid”
 We started using the free version and we loved the way to work with this tool, the paid versions bring many features that make it very competitive compared to other market options. I recommend it for medium or small companies that are starting and do not want to invest in a very expensive CRM.
 In Apptivo almost everything can be customized. It has triggers that let users build custom workflow automation rules for any app, base rules on specific events, or look at events over time.
","I would like to have better analytical reports, campaign segmentation, delivery tracking, spam check, however, these features do not prevent enjoy this tool.
"
2018-01-11,2018,"Very useful and well integrated software”
 I really like the fact that it integrates with the HR and CRM modules.
 This software has many great features. I really like how the software integrates with other components like the HR and CRM modules. I like that this software includes the Gantt View for scheduling.
","I would like to see the WBS available in this software. The WBS feature would also be nice if it was a graphic /mindmap view instead of a list view. It would really assist in planning.
"
2017-12-28,2017,"Prasanna was great to work with..”
 Easy to use... has many features to use... This program does more then you think.. Online support has always been great.
","Software runs a little slow.. Still learning about the program to know what I like and don't. Hope to learn more..
"
2017-12-23,2017,"Great for sub/contractors”
 Keeping track of contractors work and increasing accountability.
 I like the ability to the client date is all in one place which makes researching transactions and such a breeze , also that the software is equipped with invoicing abilities which makes record keeping easy as well.
","one of the things that I personally did not like was the amount of time that it takes to adequately set up this software, it takes in my opinion too much time to set up and that can be a bit of a turn off.
"
2017-12-14,2017,"Works Just Fine”
 Happy enough with this product for the price it does what we need it to do.
 Works well for our purposes. I know for sure we do not use the system to its fullest potential but the business is fairly new and we have reworked our process several times. It has still been very helpful despite our under utilization. It is something I plan to correct. Great customer support though and a good amount of customization options
","A lot of work to set up correctly and get it to do what you need it to. Does not directly incorporate facebook leads (our businesses primary source of new leads currently)
"
2017-12-12,2017,"Great way for multiple people on a team to manage and use contacts”
 This software is key to organizing and maintaining addresses!
 Apptivo is a program that our ministry uses to keep our subscriber addresses organized and updated. We have several people on our team going in to make changes on a consistent basis, and this program helps track who has changed what and when. Also, we have multiple lists with thousands of addresses, and it can handle the large volume.
","The only con I would state is that we use abbreviated states in order to send mail cass certified. Apptivo uses the full name of states, so we have to use formulas when we export to Excel in order to print labels correctly. It can be a hassle.
"
2017-12-28,2017,"A solid solution for managing clients and incoming cases for a quickly growing business. ”
 Managing our customer service and response time.
 Apptivo was relatively quick and easy to install, especially compared to larger CRM platforms. It was easy to train out team and quickly take control of customer service and response time by turning every email into a case. Having an easy way to search cases/customers and have a history of all our interactions with them has made a great improvement on our business this past year, particularly during our busy season.
","There needs to be a way to file archived emails and we wish the email app and CRM cases app were interlinked.
"
2017-11-17,2017,"Apptivo wow!”
 what I really like about this program is the customer service that is provided. it is one of the best i have come across and they are extremely helpful
","tracking connections and does not import a lot of the useful data to and from quickbooks like i would want.
"
2017-11-16,2017,"Excellent”
 Helps me rotate my clients and clean my other CRM system. Is nice to use new systems and learn new products.
","It rotates clients. Customer Service is very good attentive. It works well with my existing crm. I will continue and pay.
"
2017-11-09,2017,"Good entry CRM app”
 Report package is just what we need and not over-complicated. Ability to have a single repository for sales and order history.
 The learning curve isn't as steep as some other apps, which makes it a great CRM introductory product to enhance your sales efforts. This helps when you have different work styles you are trying to get on the same page. Reports are clean and concise, which is absolutely necessary for understanding sales stages and forecasting.
","When customizing, you can be limited to quantity of fields you can add. Surprisingly, it does not have standard a field for product.
"
2017-10-30,2017,"Great out of the box”
 I like the tech support the best. They are fantastic makes the product a great fit for us. The tracking is a little weak but a steal for the money.
","Missing some of the tracking connections and does not import a lot of the useful data to and from quickbooks.
"
2017-10-19,2017,"The starter software for a CRM”
 If you are a good self learner this could be a great SW to start a CRM with and then you can add modules as you go along. Great value .
 The software is easy to change once you use and understand the relationships between the modules. You have the ability to change the names of fields throughout the software . Very flexible.
","The documentation is not readily available and the fields are not clearly explained. It seem as if they just wrote the software and did not document it well.
"
2017-10-02,2017,"Best IT people I worked with”
 I think after we get all the kinks out, it will be just fine.
 The support staff is the best. From now on I will only ask for them. Fixed all my problems that took one day, others tried for two weeks and I never did get a response on anything I needed help with.
","Other IT support agents would not be able to help me. They never let me know if they tried to fix anything.
"
2017-09-23,2017,"Good Support”
 Live Chat is a really good feature.
 The product has many features and the 24/7 Support is great, really helpful when trying to set everything up.
","It's not easy to find every feature and there is lots of things needed to get any feature to work. Sometimes the Live Chat can disconnect you as well if you refresh the page and you have to start all over again.
"
2017-09-06,2017,"So far, I like this software”
 I am still in the testing phase of this software. Currently testing one other. So far, It looks like Apptivo will win. The best part is the live help via the chat window 24/7. They ALWAYS solve my problem right away. Only once they couldn't but it was due to a glitch which they immediately turned over to the tech guys to fix. Outstanding support goes a long way.
 Seems to have all of the tools that I need and the simplicity of this software gives me more time to focus on my clients projects instead of spending hours on the CRM like some of the other CRM packages.
","The interface is nice, but could be better. However, this is more of a personal preference. I like things to take up the least amount of screen space as possible. Although the software is highly customizable, yo cannot reduce the field sizes. They appear large and clunky in some windows.
"
2017-08-16,2017,"I am a beginner with Apptivo CRM and I needed advice and help with setting up.”
: The good organization of the management of my eMails and the relations with the customers, on the other hand, the ease of searching eMails.
 The service quality of the Apptivo team was excellent. I was accompanied until the complete resolution of the parameterization problems. The quality of the relationship was excellent. The CRM software is one of the best suited to customer relationship management needs. It is, complete, simple and accessible. I am very satisfied.
","The assignment of eMails to contacts and customers, as well as the management of leads. It's very simple and it's very flexible. On the other hand, it works well in impa with Google Apps.
"
2017-07-27,2017,"Concept of having all parts of the system connect is nice, but unfortunately it creates more headaches than it's worth.
","Nice concept, really buggy. It's super glitchy. There are more bugs in this system than I ever seen. I also don't think the engineers who built this have ever worked with an actual business. There were simple things that would never fly in a serious business. For example, the reports it generates are discounted by a factor of probability of closing a sale, and cannot be adjusted. So reports don't reflect actual values of the sales pipeline. Over 1 year, I spent way too much time reporting issues hat were often met with ""thank you for your recommendation, we will submit a request to engineering for this improvement"". Super frustrating. In other cases, there were apps that were not even accessible to my employees, for reasons that couldn't be explained to me. 4 months later, they still can't access.
"
2017-07-20,2017,"Apptivo for small business”
 Highly recommend.
 The functionality for the price is fantastic for a small business. Choose from 50 apps in the CRM package and no matter how many of the apps you use, the price is the same. Integrates with many other apps including RingCentral. Tech support is very responsive 24/7 via Chat and email.
","Somewhat complex to set-up the first time, however, the program is very flexible. Because of the flexibility, the complexity is increased.
"
2017-07-17,2017,"Thinking about apptivo?”
 Great CRM, with excellent customer service. def worth a try.
 Great system to get you started and beyond. The ""if you dont know just ask"" concept is great. i use it all the time
","a little to easy at times. there should be more control for advanced users. Even though most folks wont need it..the ability should be there
"
2017-07-12,2017,"Excellent CRM- fits all our needs better than others I researched, extremely user-friendly and best staff”

2017-07-12,2017,"Thought it was a joke”
 Can the apptivo team bring more in the future ? We hope so.
 Never ever met a software for business management with everything onboard and much ease of use. My team is is blowing up with joy and exploding with productivity. Business will never be the same again. We just got customizing everything to suite our specific needs. We are glad to be here.

"
2017-06-07,2017,"Easy to set up, we began using it right away!”
 Ability to manage and track cases and projects. Ability to easily track and see employees projects and cases.
 Ease of use. We needed something to track and manage cases and we didn't have time for a lengthy set up. With Apptivo's design and ease of use we were able to get it going right away and then integrate and add more features gradually as we went along. I also really like how you can customize each app to fit your businesses needs. We have a very niche business and being able to track the details of each of orders and customers has been very helpful.
","The email app needs further development. I'd like to be able to archive my emails into different folders.

 The UI/UX very intuitive and FAQs are very detailed. Customer Service has been extremely helpful in my immediate questions and have no doubt that will continue. Product is also very customizable as we only wanted the CRM functionality not leads/opportunities.

2017-05-01,2017,"Amazing value, Flexible and full of useful features.. They love their clients”
 I spent a combined couple of weeks researching for CRM with good features, mailing lists and flexibility for custom fields and tags. Most were $ per user per month for BASIC package. This is hands down the best value for the money with all the functionality they offer. Customer service are quick to respond and extremely helpful. I love this product and the way the company treats its clients!
 Great price, feature rich, customer service is prompt to assist and go out of their way to make sure client is satisfied.
","Would be nice to have better documentation with table of contents and explanation for every feature.. The ""Answers"" section seems to 'Sort of' do the job
"
2017-04-30,2017,"The interface, functionality and configurability of Apptivo CRM is superb. ”
 Quick setup, compartmentalized functionality so we can add features as we go along, and of course the ability to track our contacts, customers, and sales. This makes it not just a CRM system, but also an invoice and accounting system and reporting tool. At its price point, its features and full support, it is hard to beat.
 The heuristics of the interface provides the user with an natural environment to learn and work within. It's configurability is superb and it's modular functionality provides the right amount of compartmentalization that allows the user to focus on just the features the need. This enhances navigation and the user's learning curve. On top of all this, Apptivo provides top notch support, even through the trial phases of their product. Their support representatives are online 24/7, and in one instance, Mani provided me an upgrade and customization for my particular application. With such competent and helpful free product support, I have total confidence in our companies ability to roll out a great implementation of CRM. All of the features we desire are available on a mobile platform, so we really couldn't ask for much more.
","A few minor quibbles, none functionally inhibiting. In creating views the product automatically alphabetized them and I would have preferred to display them in a custom order. Between Apps, which are really views, their is not a 2-way synchronization of fields, only a one-way push is offered. The product keeps a history of all changes, so we have yet to notice weeknesses in how user accounts are handled.
"
2017-04-28,2017,"Outstanding Customer Services!!! Also, especially considering the price point”
 We use Apptivo for CRM for our contact management. It's easy to use, and the recent update is wonderful. I really appreciate the ability to customize everything I want and need, from the fields and look at the workflow for each contact.
","Nothing so far. I have had great interaction with support team. I was satisfied.

2017-04-26,2017,"Excellent Customer Support ”
 I had a really annoying issue that had me frustrated all morning about importing a product list.

Very high level of customer service.
 Easy to setup, easy to use and amazing customer support. Recommendation: No real marketing features but if you have been banging your head against the wall trying to find a CRM that lets you keep everything in one place then this is your best bet

2016-11-28,2016,"Customer Support is very Responsive”
 Our business started Apptivo when we were quite small, and there were several issues with the program when we first began using them. The support at Apptivo is awesome, every time that we have a difficulty using any of the programs feature, they have gotten back to us within hours or sometimes days. The recent issue with using their Ledger App took a bit longer to resolve but we enthusiastically appreciate their dedication to resolving the issues, and how thoroughly they did resolve it. The features we use most often include: Emailing Invoices and Estimates, keeping track of our Finances with their Ledger App, and keeping track of correspondence with Clients. There are some many other features to the program including tracking Inventory, tracking Accounts with Suppliers, and creating Projects with clients/collaborations with other professionals just to name a few. I will continue to use and support the Apptivo program. They continue to grow and offer more features, clearer and efficient options for tracking the growth of our business as it continues to grow!
 Easy to use features - Sending out invoices - Receiving payments and notifications - Receving Emails and Client feedback - Tracking client info - Reviewing, Updating, and tracking Inventory and Accounts Payables. There are many other features but these we use in general.
","""Some errors with Invoices through paypal that require the client to input the info more than once, especially when there is Updates to the program. This has happened on some occasions, but is no longer an issue that we experience.

2016-09-22,2016,"Good Starting CRM”
 The functionality of it is amazing and for a startup business the cost is low. I haven't found a CRM that is better for the price. Don't get me wrong different businesses have different needs but for IT consulting it fits all of my needs. Also support is amazing.
","Haven't really found any dislikes at the moment besides I would like to see an integration with Quick Books.
"
2016-09-20,2016,"Best bang for the buck”
 Ease of use - the product is very easy to use. They have a number of applications ( Estimates , Invoices) that integrate with CRM and makes our lives easier. And there is no additional cost to use the additional applications. The customer services people were very helpful and scheduled multiple demos for us.
","Nothing really. I am very happy with my decision to go with Apptivo.

2016-09-13,2016,"Great Customer Support Converted Me Into a Client”
 After downloading the Apptivo software, I imported my Customer List via a .csv file. All went quite easily. A few pull-down menus to get my fields in proper order, and the import of 600+ customers came in seamlessly. I had a few questions for Support, and they were VERY helpful. Great Support has inssured that I will be a client of Apptivo for a long time.
 Ease of use, mobile phone app., and price.
","an on-line manual would be helpful.

2016-08-23,2016,"Best for competitive sales team”
 We bought and tested a dozen CRM's to find one that 1. Allowed all sales people to see each others performance and deals. 2. Was SUPER intuitive to use both on desk top and mobile. 3. Was reasonably priced. Apptivo beat all the others. The only one that even came close was ZOHO. IT was free but the reporting, even in the paid version, was just terrible both in content and user experience.
","The only improvements I would make is to allow sales goals that are units vs. $$ and allowing input of multi-month Opportunities.

2016-07-12,2016,"Very Well Done CRM- Flexibility, Power, Simplicity, and Support”
: Highly flexible yet powerful solution. Support and assistance is stelar. This is the most balanced CRM package we could find and we looked at all of them. Very well done all around. The balance of power, features, simplicity, support and cost pretty much made all other solutions seem weak. The challenge of CRMs is to find the right balance. Apptivo achieved this very nicely. Evaluate your CRM based on support, simplicity, flexibility, support, and customization. We also found the price point of Apptivo to be a great value.
","Like all CRM, there's a learning curve. They're all like this. That being said, we found Apptivo to be the easiest to build into which reduced the initial learning curve quite a bit.
"
2016-07-08,2016,"Apptivo is great”
: As far as overall tracking of your business, I would say Apptivo is that way to go. You can track potential sales, vendors, customers; and is customization is easy.
: I don't even know where to start. So much integration. It's pretty sweet.
","I think the project management portion could be more robust.

2016-06-09,2016,"Love apptivo”
 we road tested over 10 CRM software programs. Apptivo won. they're all time consuming to set up and take time to learn. we only use it basically but are now just wanting to get more out of it. compared with other programs, the cost is incredible for what you get. The service was one of the things that stood out, 24hrs a day we get online help and feel like we're not alone. Other programs couldn't even help us in the sales process so we thought after sales service would be rubbish with them. Love apptivo. Would I look at other programs like infusionsoft in the future... possibly and only if apptivo stopped improving their program. But every time i think i want something.... apptivo give it to me. would i want to change some things in it... yeah for sure, but for the price, it's awesome thank you!

 Easy to navigate, nice interface, easy customization once you learn where the customization takes place, absolutely excellent customer support, readily available to answer all questions whether by phone or on line chat. It is 12:13 AM and I am just really digging in and Karthi has been with me via chat answering all my questions as I go. In less than one hour I have fully customized the customer interface to match exactly what we are seeking and have learned to quickly export data into Excel for use as desired for our production meetings. I know there is much more to experience and use in Apptivo, but am off to an excellent start. I have tried Zoho and others, but the support and ease with Apptivo is thus far unparalleled. I have stopped my CRM search and now on to implementation sooner than expected. Thanks!

 I've been using Apptivo for nearly 2 years. Value for money it is definitely the best. I'm a businessmen that has used a lot of CRM products over the years. We specialise in using (and seeking) excellence. The most important part of any product is it's support. Apptivo has never failed in support. We trust this so much we won't go anywhere else.

2015-11-24,2015,-,"Lots of Missed Promises and Marginal Support”
 We purchased Apptivo with lots of promises about what it could do and yet, even some of the basic stuff doesn't work. The idea that there is online customer service right in the app is great - but it appears like anyone near the help computer in their office answers that help window so you, more often than not, get a ""we'll send it to development"" response which means you will never see an answer. They say their app can ""sniff"" your email transactions and provide a record in the clients profile if you integrate with Gmail, but sadly they do not and they simply do not answer to any customer service inquiry dealing with the issue I have asked about the same issue three times and never gotten the courtesy of a response. And that's not the first time we have experience less-than-steller support, we have had to do this on multiple occasions with similar outcomes. We have asked many times about even the simplest things they should be able to do like print a profile page, which to my amazement they cannot do . It sounds cool that you have all these apps but it isn't really well integrated and they seem like too small a company to really get this thing robust. It is better than Excel for sure but it has a long way to go even for even the low rate they charge. Pay a little more, get a product that is ready for prime time and has a support team willing to follow-up. I came back here to this site to look for a better CRM than this.

 We are currently only using the free service, but that does not mean that we get a lesser service. We mainly use the app for the google contacts sync function.

2015-09-18,2015,"Smooth UI, Highly Customizable, Impeccable Customer Service”
 I evaluated about 5 or 6 CRMs for a couple of businesses I manage and I found Apptivo the easiest to understand and it still harnessed a lot of power. Setting up and customizing a CRM to fit your own business needs is a daunting task. I really appreciate how they have 24/7 chat support (which is up most of the time, all hours of the night) so I can get a quick answer any time I get stuck or have a quick question -- this is a huge timesaver than sorting through a knowledge base (which they have a thorough knowledge base too for those who like to read). There are some things I'd like to see them deliver such as their Wordpress plugin could be a bit more customizable where, via the Leads section, you can cherry pick your custom fields to be populated on the notification email. Also, the ability to send to multiple email addresses (from this same plugin) would be a nice feature too -- I have already alerted them of my wishes and they said they're on the roadmap. Two thumbs way up, keep up the good work guys.
",-
2015-09-16,2015,"Good, need some improvement in some apps.”
 It is very good. It offers A LOT!! However, having so much apps could be a limitation because not all of them are really powerful. In fact, ""items"" app is little bit limited for companies in the distribution business. Multicurrency is still missing in several apps, even if it was asked for by several companies. the Mobile App is still very limited and roadmaps difficult to understand. Companies buy CRM based on roadmaps as well, because they need investment protection. Besides this, is very easy to use, support is good, in general apps offer a 60% needs of organizations and with some customization using the ""customize forms"" is it possible to adapt better to actual needs. Hope they keep growing and improving.

2015-08-27,2015,"Product is pefect for small businesses, and is VERY SCALABLE pricewise and variety of apps”
 I looked for days to find just the right CRM system to manage my web design business. I chose apptivo because they let you have access to every single app at no extra charge, they charge me 10 bucks per user, so as my business grows, it will cost a little more, but the support team is there 24/7 in a drop down box that you can just click on inside your login area. They answer right away, send you help links, and walk you through anything you need to solve the issue at hand. i am going to even write a blog post in my web site, www.blueyperlink.com recommending them for all my self employed, that's how much i like it! Most of my web site clints are small business people and they can use Apptivo too, it's everything from Leads to Invoices, that's the ENTIRE CYCLE OF BUSINESS. It works for companies with suppliers, products inventory, just about any kind of business can use this. And it integrates with Google apps too! It's the best!

: Overall a good CRM.

Support is quick and accurate.","No duplicate entry protection, Estimates cannot be created with discounts added to the individual line items, Price changes must be done individually and not to the entire price book at once which is extremely cumbersome when you have over 2500 products in your price book..

 I generally have a good grasp of CRM systems and how to use them. With Apptivo, I've attempted creating some intense process flows.

As it turns out, we've redesigned several of our business process as a direct result of using Apptivo. In all cases, things are much simpler and more efficient. Every representative I've spoken with has been knowledgeable and helpful with addressing any questions we've had about using the system.

2015-07-20,2015,-,"Great product. Some of the must have features for our business are still a work in progress, but once they are available - I'd jump on this product. Things we need are pretty minor, but hope they get the attention it needs: - Need timesheets to require a customer input. Currently timesheets can be created without a customer and that creates problems, since approved timesheets cannot be edited or deleted. - Need to be able to enter timesheet involving multiple customers/projects in the same period. Currently, users have to enter multiple timesheets for the same period if they worked on different customers - Our timesheet periods are set to weekly, and our week begins on a Monday. But it doesn't force the users to have a Mon-Sun period. They are able to submit time that begins in the middle of the week (Thu-Wed). - Once the above timesheet changes are implemented, would also like to see a user being limited to one timesheet per period. Don't want duplicate timesheets unnecessarily, specially since they cannot be deleted once approved - For a service oriented business, we need to be able to track an employee's time such that it gives us cost, as well as earnings, so profitability (and payroll calculations) become easier. - When each employee signs up, they have to go add each app that they have been given access to. This adds a lot of training and onboarding overhead to us. We'd like to be able to add apps to employees' accounts at an admin level, so they just have to log in and start using the apps - Similar to the last point above, we would also like to be able to control the look/feel of each of our employees' accounts. We've setup the color schemes to match the company brandings, but they don't reflect in our employees' logins. Other than these missing features, it's a great product! The customer support is exceptional. I've never seen such a dedicated support staff who is available to answer questions and help you get started so quickly.

I am only in the early stages of using Apptivo, but a quick tour of what is available is very impressive upon first sight. I will come back and post another review for the other Apptivo apps as I have a chance to get to know them better. I am so happy to have discovered Apptivo after spending untold hours trying to get Insightly to work for our contact sharing needs, but getting started with Insightly was like mud wrestling an eel and email support responses took a day, sometimes more. Unlike Insightly which requires you to export your contacts from Google, then do the field-mapping yourself (for dozens and dozens of exported columns) to target fields in Insightly, Apptivo just imports directly from Google Contacts and even creates Categories that correspond to your contact groups. Then those same contacts (and their groups) are shared out to co-workers or others who you specify. The interface is very clear to use and very functional and is an attractive user experience, yet not littered with eye candy nor ""gamification"". This is a solid business environment, not boring but not overdone either. More details to come as I become qualified to add them.

 I like the fantastic support, customizable forms, and employment management. These features are really well put together. On the topic of customizable forms I'll just add that you can create a form that is as extensive (or simplistic) as you need. The search function for forms is fantastically easy and advanced search gives you the option to search for any data in any specific form you have which is really really good.
","There are a couple changes needed for me to rate this 10 out of 10. I love this software, but until the following issues are fixed, we will continue to have a few frustrations with using it: -You should be able to sort every column A-Z (or by date oldest to youngest) and vice-versa not just ""Standard attributes."" -Again around filtering, if you create an input box for a date, not using the 1 standard attribute ""Date Completed"" Lets give the example of using a new field you create called ""Sales Presentation Date"". You can't sort the data by a range of dates. You can only do this for the 1 standard attribute field ""Date Completed"". We have several date fields that we NEED to be able to filter the range with (e.g. to find out how many sales visits a salesman has been on during a specific month), but we cannot do this because we cannot sort or filter by date range. -Lastly the inability to PRINT directly from Apptivo is just frustrating. You have to export it to Excel (which should be a separate button and not part of a drop down menu) and then print.

2015-02-22,2015,"Why I am choosing Apptivo”
: So, I have been test driving CRM's for the last 2 years. I have scanned and reviewed about 100 of the CRM's out there, and during the selection process only a few stood up to my requirements, being: -A solid sales pipeline (From lead to opportunity to sales to after-sales) -A great contact management system -The possibility to generate quotes that can be converted to work orders, to invoices etc -An integrated templated Project management system with pre-set task generation -Email (gmail) integration -Google apps for business integration -The possibility to add more functionality in the form of integrated apps when the need arises. At the end, and when all the nitty-gritty was tested, only 3 applications remained who were comparable, qua price and functionality. But where Apptivo stands out with head and shoulders above nearly ALL the CRM's I tested, is the quality and the availability of their support! As far as I know, ONLY Apptivo, has a free 24/7/365 online support chat from within the CRM, and I consider this as a huge plus point. I run a small B2B business supplying promotional products mostly in Southern Africa but rapidly growing and expanding our market. We are currently with six people, but I am confident that at our current growth rate, we will pass the 10 employee mark by the end of 2015. I have a deep passion for what I do and when it comes to the integration of a tool that in time becomes a keystone in my business, I need suppliers that share my passion. And this is exactly what the people of Apptivo do: Tested and proven, even today on a Sunday afternoon. Keep up the good work guys, I hope we will go a long way together! Edwin Spiessens Corp.

: -A solid sales pipeline (From lead to opportunity to sales to after-sales) -A great contact management system -The possibility to generate quotes that can be converted to work orders, to invoices etc -An integrated templated Project management system with pre-set task generation -Email (gmail) integration -Google apps for business integration -The possibility to add more functionality in the form of integrated apps when the need arises. As far as I know, ONLY Apptivo, has a free 24/7/365 online support chat from within the CRM, and I consider this as a huge plus point.
","If I have to say anything then it will be that the look of the user interface is a bit dull, but i will take this a hundred times to bells and whistles, and a quarter of the functionality and support!

2015-02-16,2015,"A lot of possibilities”
 I've been testing several invoice management systems and CRM ERPs and used to much time on it. Apptivo does have some customization flaws but nothing you can't work around. Apptivo is a complete integration of CRM and Invoice management system to control your business. There's nothing like it out there that qualifies without paying a fortune. Thumbs up for the great work

2015-02-13,2015,"Awesome support - that you rarely need!”
 This is the most tightly integrated, simple to use CRM / Projects platform I have used. (have tested and used probably 50) It is so intuitive vs. SalesForce / Zoho etc ... that you rarely need any help but when you do, the chat support right inside your account is a God-send. Kudos for a beautiful, streamlined AND robust product. Literally life-changing for the way we work.

 I just started exploring and using Apptivo this week. This morning I spent a couple of hours searching the web and website for a problem I was having generating a specific type of report - showing hours by task for a specific project. I then decided to try out the chat window and Blake had my question answered in about two minutes. It turns out that if the date fields are left blank, all of the tasks are included (with their own date ranges). Simple solution that I didn't think of. Thanks!

 Great company, so far the program has been very easy to use.

 As a business, we used other CRM systems. Apptivo was an opportunity for us to use CRM which is integrated to many other business features like project management, website integration and even an eCommerce site. So far after a more than a year of using Appivo, customer service has been great. They are almost always available. We see features being added and bugs fixed in real time. Keep up the great work! Can't wait till the next release.

2014-12-19,2014,"TOP NOTCH”
: First and foremost, customer service is awesome The application is easy and complete. My initial reason to checking this app out what because it is Google integrated. I can do everything from logging a call, creating a customer, to scheduling, attaching material allowing automating inventory, to suppliers, to invoicing. This is just a small taste to what you can do with the application. I use it for so much more! The application's server is a little slow a times. This is the only con for me.
",-
2014-12-18,2014,"Top Notch!”
 The app is perfect all around for small business. The application's options are great and has something for any small business. Integrated with Google. I literally can log calls, set up sales orders, work orders, make appointments, track and update inventory automatically, track leads, estimates, staff work on site time, load photos/documents from another source and so much more all by myself. Our company is a small business however, rapidly growing. We do everything via paper so this has improve our efficiency a great deal however, keep cost down on overhead as this does easily what you could hire 3 full time people do by hand.
 Many choices to pick and choice from at any level of account. Free version you get more than any other company offers. and as you upgrade...it gets better and better. Customer Service is awesome!
","It can be slow at times to go between each section tab and loading Some stuff does not update automatically, must be done manually.

 I use the prospecting apps and they're time savers! It's nice to have all the information in one place. Another thing I like is you only use the apps you need, but if the need arises, the other apps are there, offering an all-in-one business solution. Glad I tried Apptivo over more expensive options. This has great value and the customer service is awesome! They answer right away so you can solve your problems quickly and keep the momentum going for your marketing efforts. Highly recommend!

 I would have given 5 stars but I had a few hiccups to start the app. I had a bug which took a week or so to fix. I also was very frustrated figuring out the app the first week. If it was not for the customer service, I probably would have thrown the towel in. After a one on one webinar and constant assistance from a tech there I got it up and running. I love the customization. I have tried a couple different CRM's and to me this is the most functional. I would reccomend this for anyone looking for an affordable and efficient way to manage their leads, and customers.

2014-10-31,2014,"Great and simple CRM, awesome and fast support.”
 I just installed Apptivo throught my Google Apps account after testing out a couple more CRMs that were lacking important functionnalities and so far I am impressed. I was previously using Insightly, which is also a great CRM by the way, but it lacks too many functonalities and the chat support is weaker in my opinion. I greatly recommend that CRM/mini-ERP for your management needs.
 Awesome, friendly and fast chat support directly from the app! Handful of functionalities and options Really affordable for a multi user environment Great flexibility Lot of filters Great search function App store to get more plugins
","GUI needs a bit of tweeking to be more appealing Tends to be a bit slow some time The Ledger app needs a lot of improvement, it is not enough mature as of now to replace Zoho Invoice to track my expenses and generate taxes reports.

2014-08-20,2014,"Fantastic Software, Fantastic Support! Overall: Have been using Apptivo for a while now and have been blown away by the amount of effort that has been put into this online software package. Really well designed and easy to use. Also mostly intuitive workflows. The Support has been second to none, they have an on-page live chat which is usualy responded to within 60 seconds and then you can ask all your questions and I've never once not received information to help me through. Fantastic Software, Fantastic support! A real role model for how online Software should work and be supported.
Pros: Easy field creation, easy setup and a good level of depth for creating and personalising to your business' need. Massive PRO is the support and FAQ's for this software. they have a live chat feature on every page so help is only a couple seconds away
","There are a couple things that could be added to make it work a little better, like a Lead # Generator and the ability to remove ALL fields if required . You are given a fair amount of creative licence but there are a few odd restrictions.

2014-08-18,2014,"Getting started on the right foot!”
 My business is just starting to delve into the wholesale market. I'm pretty much a solopreneur so I don't need a lot of collaborative tools, but I did want to be able to stay on top of who I talked to and when and who ordered what and when--in short I wanted to be able to provide my customers with excellent support, and I knew I needed a solid database to keep track of our interactions. I'm also attending a few tradeshows and I need a way to write up invoices quickly and request payment electronically. Apptivo gives me all of that and MORE, a lot more--some of which I know I'm not ready to use, but I'm glad it's there when I need it. In app chat support is speedy and excellent. The program is highly customizable. Overall, I feel like I'm getting a tool set that used to be reserved only for the largest of my competitors who could afford to spend big bucks on software. If my business is David and theirs is Goliath, I just replaced my slingshot with a bazooka.
 Affordable. All features included in one price. Use only what you need. Use more as you grow into it. Very well documented. Excellent FAST support. Highly customizable.
","No complaints, but if I could suggest two features, these would make this software PERFECT for what I need: SImplified Sales Order process. For quick input at tradeshows. Integration with Shipstation for shipping orders.

 Ok, so I just need a CRM to help me manage all me trade show leads and client sales I'm in charge of. Only thing is I'm no computer wiz. I first tried Salesforce and got completely lost in how to do anything on that freaking page. SOOOO much information seemed to be required about each lead, that it got overwhelming and the customer support was seriously lacking so i gave up. I tried Apptivo based on the reviews about their great customer service. I took off a star because it was a SERIOUS pain in the butt trying to upload the leads from my last show. But the 4 stars are for the awesome customer service. I pretty much always had the same guy, Blake, helping me out which was awesome so i didnt have to keep re-explaining everything. He was patient and extremely helpful. And he was always right there to help me out in the live chat bubble. We got it all figured out so i can get to work now on my sales.
 Amazing customer service Blake my service associate

 I have worked with two other CRMs. This solution beats them both for single users or groups up to 50. The cost is ONLY $10 per user/month. You determine each user's apps that are required for their job role. These apps may also be rolled out in phases. You company can 'ease into' CRM at your pace.
 You can design a CRM solution around your business. This is because of the dozens of apps that you get access to for no additional charge. This is a full-featured CRM product and mini-ERP system. It is as flexible as it is powerful. Wow.

 After having worked over 10 years with Salesforce.com and ZOHO a bit shorter, I have to admit that Apptivo is doing the right things. While SFDC and ZOHO are disjointed, Apptivo is living from the same data repository, so all the different apps have the same parent platform to live on. It is really easy to set up and once you get started, it is just so much easier to work with, than ZOHO is, as an example. Have a go with the free trial, you will be amazed.
